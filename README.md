This contains a Basic Flask App that fetches data from two different csv files, calculates some metrices and returns the resultant merged data.

To run the API:

1. python .\app.py
2. curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate_asset_report?start_time=1628162400&end_time=1628176800" 
   -> Replace the URL and port to which the Flask app got hosted. 
   -> change the start_time and end_time as needed
